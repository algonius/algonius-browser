- **Files Modified**:
  - `chrome-extension/src/background/mcp/host-manager.ts` - Fixed connect() method
  - `chrome-extension/src/background/index.ts` - Updated message handling to use connect() properly
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Connection and host startup now work correctly

### Fixed Status Update Broadcasting
- **Issue**: Status updates weren't being broadcast to popup components
- **Solution**: Added automatic status broadcasting in McpHostManager.updateStatus()
- **Files Modified**: `chrome-extension/src/background/mcp/host-manager.ts`
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Status updates now properly propagate to UI

### Fixed Stop Button Status Update Issue
- **Issue**: Stop button in popup didn't immediately update status to "Disconnected"
- **Root Cause**: Background script was calling `mcpHostManager.disconnect()` twice - once in `stopMcpHost()` and again manually, causing conflicting status updates
- **Solution**: Modified background script to rely on `stopMcpHost()` internal disconnect handling
- **Files Modified**: `chrome-extension/src/background/index.ts`
- **Changes Made**:
  - Removed redundant `mcpHostManager.disconnect()` calls after `stopMcpHost()` success
  - Added conditional disconnect only when still connected and `stopMcpHost()` failed
  - Improved error handling to check connection status before forcing disconnect
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Stop button now immediately updates UI status to disconnected

### Stop Button Status Update Fix (2025-05-25)
Successfully resolved an issue where the stop button in the popup didn't immediately update the status to "Disconnected":

**Problem Analysis**:
- The background script was calling `mcpHostManager.disconnect()` twice:
  1. Once internally by `stopMcpHost()` method (which handles graceful shutdown and disconnection)
  2. Once manually after `stopMcpHost()` completed successfully
- This caused conflicting status updates and prevented the UI from showing the correct disconnected state

**Solution Implemented**:
- Modified the background script's `stopMcpHost` message handler to rely on the internal disconnect handling
- Removed redundant `mcpHostManager.disconnect()` calls after successful `stopMcpHost()` completion
- Added conditional disconnect logic that only forces disconnection if:
  - The `stopMcpHost()` method failed completely AND
  - The host is still showing as connected
- Enhanced error handling to check connection status before attempting forced disconnection

**Benefits**:
- Stop button now immediately updates UI status to "Disconnected"
- Eliminated conflicting status update messages
- Improved reliability of graceful shutdown process
- Better error handling for edge cases

**Files Modified**:
