## Known Issues

Based on code analysis and architecture review, we've identified several current limitations and challenges:

### Software Development Processes

#### Test-Driven Development
- âœ… **Systematic Test Workflow**: Established a process for addressing test failures:
  1. **Identification**: Run test suite to identify failing tests
  2. **Analysis**: Examine test structure and the mechanism being tested
  3. **Multiple Approaches**: Try different testing strategies when facing challenges
  4. **Decision Making**: Make practical decisions about test coverage vs. stability
  5. **Documentation**: Record testing challenges and solutions for future reference
- âœ… **Mocking Strategy**: Developed comprehensive mocking for Chrome Extensions API:
  - Global mock setup for chrome.runtime in test initialization
  - Port object mocking with message and disconnect event listeners
  - Message callback capture and simulation
  - Timer control for time-dependent operations
- âœ… **Test Isolation**: Created properly isolated tests with cleanup between runs:
  - Test setup with vi.clearAllMocks() and vi.useFakeTimers()
  - Test teardown with vi.clearAllMocks() and vi.useRealTimers()
  - Preventing test contamination with proper isolation

#### Technical Challenges
- **Vitest Timer Handling**: Some timer-based tests require careful implementation to avoid infinite loops
- **Mocking Chrome Extensions API**: Testing native messaging requires properly mocking the Chrome Extensions API
- **MCP Host Communication**: Testing MCP Host communication requires reliable event handling and message validation
- **Test Case Dependencies**: Some test cases may have interdependencies that complicate isolated testing
- **Mock Timing Issues**: Tests involving timeouts and intervals require precise timer control

### LLM Integration Challenges
- **Context Window Limitations**: Large web pages can exceed model context limits
- **Token Cost Management**: Planning and validation phases have high token usage
- **Structured Output Parsing**: Occasional parsing failures with complex outputs
- **Provider-Specific Behaviors**: Inconsistencies between different LLM providers

### Browser Automation Challenges
- **Dynamic Content Handling**: Difficulties with rapidly changing page content
- **Shadow DOM Support**: Limited interaction with shadow DOM elements
- **iFrame Traversal**: Challenges accessing content within nested iframes
- **Element Selection Reliability**: Index-based selection can be brittle after DOM changes

### Architecture Limitations
- **Error Recovery**: Some error conditions lead to unrecoverable states
- **Long-Running Tasks**: Performance degradation with extended execution times
