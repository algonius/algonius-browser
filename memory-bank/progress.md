   - Optimized waiting periods for better reliability

3. **Error Handling**
   - Descriptive error messages with context
   - Element validation before typing
   - Fallback strategies for challenging inputs
   - Detailed error codes for troubleshooting

**Technical Implementation - Frontend:**
- New handler class: `TypeValueHandler` in `chrome-extension/src/background/task/type-value-handler.ts`
- Registered as RPC method: `type_value`
- Parameter validation with detailed error messages
- Progressive typing approach for improved reliability
- 150+ lines of robust typing implementation

**Technical Implementation - Backend (added December 13, 2025 4:06 AM):**

- Test coverage for basic functionality, parameter validation, special keys, and timeout behavior
- Verified proper handling of different element types (text inputs, selects, checkboxes)
- Special test cases for keyboard simulation features:
  - Special key input (Enter, Tab)
  - Modifier combinations (Ctrl+A)
  - Mixed content (e.g., "hello{Enter}world")
- Validation that tool removes explicit keyboard_mode parameter (now auto-detected)
- Detailed operation tracking tests
- Progressive typing strategy tests with different text lengths
- Timeout validation including auto timeout and explicit timeout values

**Implementation Status:**
- ✅ Frontend component: Complete
- ✅ Backend component: Complete

- 🔄 End-to-end testing: Planned across all website categories

**Next Step:** Comprehensive testing across website categories

### Latest Bug Fix - get_dom_extra_elements Test

**🔧 Test Bug Fix - get_dom_extra_elements Integration Test**
- **Issue**: Test case failing in `mcp-host-go/tests/integration/get_dom_extra_elements_test.go` due to outdated tool description assertion
- **Root Cause**: Tool description was updated in implementation, but test assertion was still checking for the old text "Get additional DOM interactive elements"
- **Fix Applied**: Updated assertion to check for new description text "Get interactive elements in the current viewport"
- **Impact**: All three test functions now pass:
  - TestGetDomExtraElementsToolBasicPagination
  - TestGetDomExtraElementsToolElementFiltering
  - TestGetDomExtraElementsToolParameterValidation
- **Date Fixed**: December 13, 2025, 4:44 AM
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Verified with successful test runs
