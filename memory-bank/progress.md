## Recent Progress

### Build System Optimization (2025-05-24)
Completed comprehensive optimization of the mcp-host-go build system and development workflow:

1. **Makefile Warning Resolution**:
   - **Root Cause Analysis**: Identified BUILD_DIR=build caused conflicts with target definitions
   - **Solution Implementation**: Changed BUILD_DIR from 'build' to 'bin' for consistency
   - **Result**: Completely eliminated "overriding recipe" and "circular dependency" warnings
   - **Verification**: Clean build process with no warnings using `make build`

2. **Install Script Enhancement**:
   - **Smart Binary Detection**: Updated install.sh to check for existing binary in bin/ directory
   - **Conditional Building**: Only rebuilds if binary doesn't exist, otherwise uses existing
   - **Workflow Simplification**: Removed unnecessary file copying operations from Makefile
   - **Path Consistency**: Aligned script paths with BUILD_DIR=bin configuration

3. **Git Configuration**:
   - **Comprehensive .gitignore**: Created complete Go project .gitignore covering:
     - Binary executables and build artifacts (bin/, build/, *.exe)
     - Go-specific files (vendor/, *.test, *.out, go.work)
     - Development tools (.idea/, .vscode/, *.swp)
     - System files (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db) and temporary files
     - Testing and profiling files (coverage.out, *.prof)
   - **Verification**: Confirmed build artifacts are properly ignored by git

4. **Workflow Optimization**:
   - **Makefile Cleanup**: Simplified install target to directly call install.sh
   - **Process Streamlining**: Eliminated redundant operations and temporary file handling
   - **Build Consistency**: Unified build directory usage across all build tools
   - **Script Permissions**: Ensured proper executable permissions for install/uninstall scripts

5. **Testing and Validation**:
   - **Build Process**: Verified `make clean && make build` works without warnings
   - **Installation**: Tested `make install` and direct `./install.sh` execution
   - **Uninstallation**: Confirmed `./uninstall.sh` properly removes installed components
   - **Git Status**: Verified build artifacts are ignored and only source files tracked

#### Build System Benefits
- **Developer Experience**: Clean build output without distracting warnings
- **Process Reliability**: Consistent build directory usage prevents conflicts
- **Workflow Efficiency**: Intelligent install script reduces unnecessary rebuilds
- **Version Control Hygiene**: Proper .gitignore prevents accidental commits of build artifacts
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Scripts work correctly on Linux/macOS environments

### Dual Server Implementation (2025-05-24)
Successfully implemented a dual MCP server that supports both Native Messaging and SSE protocols:

1. **SSE Server Implementation**:
   - Integrated `mark3labs/mcp-go` library for SSE-based MCP communication
   - Created `pkg/sse/server.go` implementing SSE-based MCP server
   - Adapted internal types to mark3labs MCP format for tools and resources
   - Implemented proper schema conversion for tool parameters
   - Added HTTP server capabilities for external MCP client access

2. **Dual Server Architecture**:
   - Created `pkg/dual/server.go` for unified server management
   - Supports both Native Messaging (Chrome extension) and SSE (external clients)
   - Registers tools and resources with both server implementations
   - Provides unified start/stop/status management
   - Ensures consistent behavior across both protocols

3. **Main Application Updates**:
   - Updated `main.go` to use the new dual server
   - Added environment variable configuration for SSE server
   - Configurable port, base URL, and base path for SSE endpoint
   - Enhanced logging to show both server endpoints
   - Graceful shutdown for both servers

4. **Build and Testing**:
   - All code compiles successfully with Go build system
   - Fixed type compatibility issues with mark3labs/mcp-go
   - Binary builds correctly with make build
   - Ready for testing with external MCP clients

This implementation enables the MCP host to serve both:
- **Native Messaging**: Chrome extension integration (existing functionality)
- **SSE**: External AI tools and frameworks via HTTP/SSE protocol

### Go MCP Host Implementation (2025-05-23)
Created a complete Go-based implementation of the MCP host with a clean architecture approach:

1. **Clean Architecture**: 
   - Implemented layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
   - Used dependency injection to ensure loose coupling between components
   - Created well-defined interfaces for all major components

2. **Core Components**:
   - **Logger Package**: Structured logging with configurable levels
   - **Types Package**: Core interfaces and data structures
   - **Messaging Package**: Chrome Native Messaging protocol implementation
   - **MCP Server Package**: Server component handling MCP requests
   - **Resources Package**: Browser state resource implementations
   - **Tools Package**: Browser operation tool implementations
   - **Main Application**: Wire-up with dependency injection

3. **Build System**:
   - Created comprehensive Makefile with targets for:
     - Building the binary
     - Installing the host
     - Uninstalling the host
     - Running tests
     - Performing static analysis
     - Managing dependencies
   - Added support for cross-platform builds

4. **Installation Scripts**:
   - Created install.sh script for building and installing the host
   - Added uninstall.sh script for clean removal
   - Ensured Chrome registration via Native Messaging manifest

5. **Type Safety**:
   - Leveraged Go's strong typing for robust interface definitions
   - Implemented proper error handling throughout the codebase
   - Used context propagation for operation cancellation

6. **Project Structure**:
   - Organized code in logical packages
   - Created index files for package-level exports
   - Set up a clean cmd/pkg directory structure

This Go implementation provides a more performant and maintainable alternative to the Node.js-based MCP host, with improved error handling, type safety, and build process.

### MCP Host Port Conflict Resolution and Uninstall Script (2025-05-22)
Created a comprehensive solution for resolving port conflicts in the MCP Host and implemented an uninstall script for cleanup:

1. **Port Conflict Detection**: Enhanced the MCP HTTP server to properly detect and handle port conflicts:
   - Added explicit error event handler for Node.js EADDRINUSE errors
   - Improved error messages to include EADDRINUSE code for better diagnostics
   - Modified the MCP Host to exit with non-zero status code when port conflicts occur
   - Enhanced the port conflict test to correctly detect both error messages and exit codes

2. **Uninstall Script Implementation**: Created a robust uninstall.sh script with the following capabilities:
   - **Process Detection**: Identifies and terminates mcp-host processes
   - **Port Cleanup**: Detects and frees the default port 7890 or user-specified port
   - **File Cleanup**: Removes installed manifest files from Chrome/Chromium directories
   - **Log Management**: Optional cleanup of log files with --keep-logs flag
   - **Platform Support**: Works on both Linux and macOS environments
   - **Force Mode**: Includes --force option for automated cleanup without prompts
   - **Verification**: Confirms port is freed after process termination
   - **Help System**: Includes detailed help output with --help flag

This implementation solves a critical issue where MCP Host processes could remain running and block ports, making it difficult to restart the host. The uninstall script provides a user-friendly way to clean up the system and ensure a fresh installation.

### MCP RPC Handler Implementation (2025-05-22)
Implemented the `get_dom_state` RPC handler to provide a standardized way for MCP clients to access DOM state in both human-readable and structured formats. This handler follows the established RPC handler pattern with:

1. **Class-Based Structure**: Created a new `GetDomStateHandler` class with clear responsibility
2. **Dependency Injection**: Used constructor to inject BrowserContext dependency
3. **Handler Method Implementation**: Implemented the handleGetDomState method following the RpcHandler interface
4. **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive try/catch with standardized error codes
5. **Dual Data Representation**: Provided both formatted text and structured interactive elements
6. **Integration with Agent Patterns**: Aligned DOM representation with the format used by Agent system
7. **Export and Registration**: Updated task/index.ts and background/index.ts for proper integration

This implementation provides MCP clients with the ability to:
- Receive a human-readable representation of the DOM similar to what the Agent system uses
- Access structured data about interactive elements for programmatic interaction
- Get page metadata including scroll position, URL, and title
- Optionally receive page screenshots

The handler was successfully integrated into the extension's background script and is now available as an RPC method for MCP clients.

### MCP Host Control and Error Handling (2025-05-20)
Completed the implementation of MCP Host control functionality and fixed critical error handling issues:

1. **Connection Management**: Enhanced the McpHostManager to properly track connection state
2. **Status Reporting**: Implemented status reporting for connected/disconnected states
3. **Error Handling**: Fixed Native Messaging error detection and propagation
4. **UI Integration**: Connected status reporting to the Options page UI
5. **User Guidance**: Added clear installation instructions for users encountering errors

These improvements ensure that:
- The extension can reliably connect to the Native Host
- Users receive clear error messages when connection fails
- The UI accurately reflects the current connection state
- Installation instructions are clear and easy to follow
