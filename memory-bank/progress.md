# Progress: Nanobrowser

## Current Status

Nanobrowser is a functioning Chrome extension that provides AI web automation through a multi-agent system. The extension is currently available through:

1. **Chrome Web Store**: Stable version with reviewed features
2. **Manual Installation**: Latest version with newest features
3. **Source Build**: Development version for contributors

### Development Status
- **Version**: 0.1.5 (according to package.json)
- **Phase**: Early public release
- **Documentation**: Initial Memory Bank setup complete

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- âœ… **Chrome Extension Integration**: Extension loads and functions in Chrome
- âœ… **Side Panel Interface**: User can interact with agents via side panel
- âœ… **Multi-agent System**: Planner, Navigator, and Validator agents collaborate
- âœ… **LLM Provider Integration**: Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and Ollama
- âœ… **Basic Web Automation**: Navigation, clicking, form filling, and content extraction
- âœ… **Task History**: Conversation history management
- âœ… **Follow-up Questions**: Contextual follow-ups after task completion

### User Experience
- âœ… **Configuration Interface**: Users can set up API keys and select models
- âœ… **Real-time Status Updates**: Progress indicators for ongoing tasks
- âœ… **Agent Model Selection**: Different models can be assigned to different agents
- âœ… **Firefox Support**: Basic compatibility with Firefox browser

## What's Left to Build

Based on the project documentation and repository examination, the following areas are identified for future development:

### Planned Features
- ðŸ”„ **Enhanced Agent Capabilities**: More sophisticated web interaction patterns
- ðŸ”„ **Additional LLM Providers**: Integration with more LLM APIs
- ðŸ”„ **Performance Optimizations**: Reduce token usage and improve response times
- ðŸ”„ **Advanced Validation**: Better verification of task completion
- ðŸ”„ **Expanded Browser Support**: Improved cross-browser compatibility
- ðŸ”„ **Customizable Workflows**: User-defined sequences of actions
- ðŸ”„ **Plugin System**: Extensibility for community-developed capabilities

### Technical Improvements
- ðŸ”„ **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive automated testing
- ðŸ”„ **Documentation**: Detailed developer and user documentation
- ðŸ”„ **Accessibility**: Enhanced support for assistive technologies
- ðŸ”„ **Internationalization**: Support for additional languages
- ðŸ”„ **Error Handling**: More robust recovery from unexpected conditions

## Known Issues

As this is the initial Memory Bank setup, specific issues will be documented as they are identified. This section will be updated as development progresses and issues are discovered or resolved.

Current common challenges include:
- LLM context limitations when dealing with complex web pages
- Balancing token usage with effectiveness
- Handling dynamic web content and single-page applications
- Browser extension API limitations

## Evolution of Project Decisions

This section will track significant decisions and their evolution as the project progresses. As this is the initial Memory Bank setup, this section will be populated as the project matures.

### Initial Architecture Decisions
- **Multi-agent System**: Choosing specialized agents over a single agent approach
- **Local Processing**: Prioritizing privacy with local browser execution
- **Flexible LLM Options**: Supporting multiple providers rather than a single option
- **Monorepo Structure**: Organizing code in a pnpm workspace for better modularity

### Future Decision Points
- Balancing feature richness with extension performance
- Strategies for reducing LLM API costs
- Approaches to community contribution management
- Browser compatibility prioritization

## Milestones and Progress Tracking

### Completed Milestones
- âœ… Initial public release on Chrome Web Store
- âœ… Basic multi-agent system implementation
- âœ… Support for multiple LLM providers
- âœ… Memory Bank documentation system setup

### Upcoming Milestones
- ðŸ”„ Enhanced web automation capabilities
- ðŸ”„ Improved agent coordination
- ðŸ”„ Performance optimization
- ðŸ”„ Extended browser compatibility
- ðŸ”„ Community contribution expansion

This document will be regularly updated to reflect the current progress, emerging issues, and evolving priorities of the Nanobrowser project.
