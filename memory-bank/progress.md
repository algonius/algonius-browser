## Recent Progress

### MCP Host Port Conflict Resolution and Uninstall Script (2025-05-22)
Created a comprehensive solution for resolving port conflicts in the MCP Host and implemented an uninstall script for cleanup:

1. **Port Conflict Detection**: Enhanced the MCP HTTP server to properly detect and handle port conflicts:
   - Added explicit error event handler for Node.js EADDRINUSE errors
   - Improved error messages to include EADDRINUSE code for better diagnostics
   - Modified the MCP Host to exit with non-zero status code when port conflicts occur
   - Enhanced the port conflict test to correctly detect both error messages and exit codes

2. **Uninstall Script Implementation**: Created a robust uninstall.sh script with the following capabilities:
   - **Process Detection**: Identifies and terminates mcp-host processes
   - **Port Cleanup**: Detects and frees the default port 7890 or user-specified port
   - **File Cleanup**: Removes installed manifest files from Chrome/Chromium directories
   - **Log Management**: Optional cleanup of log files with --keep-logs flag
   - **Platform Support**: Works on both Linux and macOS environments
   - **Force Mode**: Includes --force option for automated cleanup without prompts
   - **Verification**: Confirms port is freed after process termination
   - **Help System**: Includes detailed help output with --help flag

This implementation solves a critical issue where MCP Host processes could remain running and block ports, making it difficult to restart the host. The uninstall script provides a user-friendly way to clean up the system and ensure a fresh installation.

### MCP RPC Handler Implementation (2025-05-22)
Implemented the `get_dom_state` RPC handler to provide a standardized way for MCP clients to access DOM state in both human-readable and structured formats. This handler follows the established RPC handler pattern with:

1. **Class-Based Structure**: Created a new `GetDomStateHandler` class with clear responsibility
2. **Dependency Injection**: Used constructor to inject BrowserContext dependency
3. **Handler Method Implementation**: Implemented the handleGetDomState method following the RpcHandler interface
4. **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive try/catch with standardized error codes
5. **Dual Data Representation**: Provided both formatted text and structured interactive elements
6. **Integration with Agent Patterns**: Aligned DOM representation with the format used by Agent system
7. **Export and Registration**: Updated task/index.ts and background/index.ts for proper integration

This implementation provides MCP clients with the ability to:
- Receive a human-readable representation of the DOM similar to what the Agent system uses
- Access structured data about interactive elements for programmatic interaction
- Get page metadata including scroll position, URL, and title
- Optionally receive page screenshots

The handler was successfully integrated into the extension's background script and is now available as an RPC method for MCP clients.

### MCP Host Control and Error Handling (2025-05-20)
Completed the implementation of MCP Host control functionality and fixed critical error handling issues:

1. **Connection Management**: Enhanced the McpHostManager to properly track connection state
2. **Status Reporting**: Implemented status reporting for connected/disconnected states
3. **Error Handling**: Fixed Native Messaging error detection and propagation
4. **UI Integration**: Connected status reporting to the Options page UI
5. **User Guidance**: Added clear installation instructions for users encountering errors

These improvements ensure that:
- The extension can reliably connect to the Native Host
- Users receive clear error messages when connection fails
- The UI accurately reflects the current connection state
- Installation instructions are clear and easy to follow

### Project Rebranding (2025-05-18)
Successfully completed the rebranding from Nanobrowser to Algonius Browser:

1. **Documentation Updates**: Updated README.md and other documentation to reflect the new name
2. **Project Goals**: Clarified the project's focus on MCP integration
3. **Acknowledgments**: Added reference to the original Nanobrowser project
4. **Memory Bank**: Updated all Memory Bank files to ensure consistent branding

This rebranding establishes a clear identity for the project and sets the stage for future development focused on MCP integration.
