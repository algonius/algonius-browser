# Progress Tracking

## Current Status: ‚úÖ ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

### Recent Achievements

#### ‚úÖ Manual Bug Report Submission (2025-06-11)
**Successfully submitted bug report through GitHub UI using browser automation:**
- **Issue Created**: [Bug]: manage_tabs tool has functionality issues (#18)
- **URL**: https://github.com/algonius/algonius-browser/issues/18
- **Testing Method**: Direct browser automation using MCP tools
- **Fields Completed**:
  - Component: Chrome Extension (selected from dropdown)
  - Environment: Linux, Chrome 131.0.6778.139, MCP Host 1.0.0, Extension 0.4.11
  - Bug Description: Detailed description with specific functionality issues
  - Steps to Reproduce: Complete reproduction steps with code examples
  - Labels: Applied "bug" label automatically

**Key Insights from Manual Testing:**
- GitHub's issue form has dynamic validation (fields appear after others are filled)
- Environment field became required after Component selection
- Form validation prevented submission until all required fields completed
- Browser automation tools worked reliably for complex form interactions
- DOM state changes during form interaction require adaptive element targeting

#### ‚úÖ Comprehensive Browser Tool Testing
**Validated all core MCP browser tools:**
1. **navigate_to**: Successfully navigated to GitHub issue creation page
2. **get_dom_extra_elements**: Effectively found and filtered form elements
3. **set_value**: Successfully filled text inputs and textareas with multi-line content
4. **click_element**: Reliably clicked buttons and dropdown options
5. **scroll_page**: Properly scrolled to reveal form sections

### What Works

#### üîß Core MCP Browser Tools
- **Navigation**: `navigate_to` tool works reliably for URL navigation
- **Element Discovery**: `get_dom_extra_elements` provides excellent pagination and filtering
- **Form Interaction**: `set_value` handles both simple text and complex multi-line content
- **Button Clicks**: `click_element` works with dynamic DOM updates
- **Scrolling**: `scroll_page` reveals hidden content as needed

#### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Components
- **Chrome Extension**: Background scripts handle MCP communication
- **Go MCP Host**: Processes tool requests and manages browser interaction
- **WebSocket Communication**: Reliable message passing between components
- **DOM State Management**: Accurate element indexing and viewport detection

#### üìã Documentation System
- Memory Bank files maintain project context effectively
- Progress tracking provides clear status visibility
- Technical documentation covers implementation details

### Current Development Focus

#### üéØ Primary Objectives
1. **Performance Optimization**: Improve tool response times and reliability
2. **Error Handling**: Enhance error reporting and recovery mechanisms
3. **Testing Coverage**: Expand automated test suite for edge cases
4. **Documentation**: Complete API documentation and user guides

#### üîÑ Active Work Areas
1. **Scrollable Container Detection**: Enhanced viewport management for complex pages
2. **Tool Timeout Handling**: Adaptive timeout mechanisms for different page types
3. **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive test suite for real-world scenarios
4. **Windows Installation**: Streamlined setup process for Windows users

### Technical Decisions

#### ‚úÖ Confirmed Architecture Choices
- **MCP Protocol**: Provides robust tool interface for browser automation
- **Go Backend**: Excellent performance for system-level browser interaction
- **Chrome Extension**: Necessary for secure DOM access and manipulation
- **WebSocket Transport**: Reliable real-time communication

#### üîß Implementation Patterns
- **Element Indexing**: Zero-based indexing with viewport-aware detection
- **DOM State Caching**: Efficient element discovery with pagination
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of dynamic DOM changes
- **Timeout Management**: Adaptive timeouts based on operation complexity

### Known Issues & Solutions

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issues
1. **manage_tabs Tool**: Tab switching functionality needs investigation (documented in Issue #18)
2. **Complex Page Handling**: Some dynamic sites require enhanced element detection
3. **Performance on Large DOMs**: Optimization needed for pages with many elements

#### üîÑ In Progress Solutions
1. **Tab Management**: Investigating Chrome Extension tab API integration
2. **Dynamic Content**: Enhanced waiting mechanisms for AJAX-loaded content
3. **Performance**: DOM state optimization and intelligent element filtering

### Next Steps

#### üéØ Immediate Priorities (Next Sprint)
1. **Investigate manage_tabs Issue**: Debug tab switching functionality
2. **Performance Testing**: Benchmark tools on various page types
3. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error recovery
