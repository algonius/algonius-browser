## Known Issues

Based on code analysis and architecture review, we've identified several current limitations and challenges:

### LLM Integration Challenges
- **Context Window Limitations**: Large web pages can exceed model context limits
- **Token Cost Management**: Planning and validation phases have high token usage
- **Structured Output Parsing**: Occasional parsing failures with complex outputs
- **Provider-Specific Behaviors**: Inconsistencies between different LLM providers

### Browser Automation Challenges
- **Dynamic Content Handling**: Difficulties with rapidly changing page content
- **Shadow DOM Support**: Limited interaction with shadow DOM elements
- **iFrame Traversal**: Challenges accessing content within nested iframes
- **Element Selection Reliability**: Index-based selection can be brittle after DOM changes

### Architecture Limitations
- **Error Recovery**: Some error conditions lead to unrecoverable states
- **Long-Running Tasks**: Performance degradation with extended execution times
- **Memory Management**: Potential memory leaks with complex browser operations
- **Event Consistency**: Occasional event propagation issues between components

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Current Architecture Decisions

#### Multi-Agent System Design
- **Decision**: Three specialized agents (Planner, Navigator, Validator) with clear responsibilities
- **Rationale**: This approach provides clear separation of concerns and enables specialized prompting
- **Evolution**: The system has evolved to include configurable planning intervals for token efficiency
- **Future Consideration**: Potential for agent specialization based on specific task types

#### Execution Flow Pattern
- **Decision**: Iterative execution loop with periodic planning and validation checkpoints
- **Rationale**: Balances strategic planning with tactical execution
- **Evolution**: Added configurability for planning frequency and validation thresholds
- **Future Consideration**: More dynamic determination of when planning is needed

#### Browser Interaction Model
- **Decision**: Index-based element selection with action intent documentation
- **Rationale**: Provides clear identification of interactive elements
- **Evolution**: Enhanced with vision-based capabilities for complex scenarios
- **Future Consideration**: Hybrid approaches combining indices with semantic understanding

#### Error Handling Strategy
- **Decision**: Progressive failure thresholds with configurable limits
- **Rationale**: Balances persistence with recognition of irrecoverable situations
- **Evolution**: Added separate thresholds for navigation and validation failures
- **Future Consideration**: More sophisticated error classification and recovery strategies

### Future Decision Points
- Balancing model capabilities with cost for different agent roles
- Strategies for reducing context window pressure in complex web pages
- Approaches to handling authentication and session management
- Methods for improving reliability with dynamic web applications
