# Project Brief: Nanobrowser

## Project Overview
Nanobrowser is an open-source AI web automation tool that runs directly in the browser as a Chrome extension. It serves as a free alternative to OpenAI Operator, offering flexible LLM options and a multi-agent system architecture.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Multi-agent System**
   - Specialized AI agents that collaborate to accomplish complex web workflows
   - Three primary agents: Navigator, Planner, and Validator

2. **Web Automation**
   - Browse and interact with websites autonomously
   - Perform complex tasks across multiple pages
   - Extract and analyze information from web pages

3. **User Interface**
   - Interactive side panel with chat interface
   - Real-time status updates of agent actions
   - Conversation history management

4. **LLM Integration**
   - Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama)
   - Custom configuration for each agent
   - Option for local model deployment

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Privacy & Security**
   - Local browser execution (no cloud services)
   - Secure handling of user credentials
   - Protection of sensitive browsing data

2. **Performance**
   - Efficient browser automation
   - Responsive user interface
   - Effective resource management

3. **Extensibility**
   - Open-source codebase
   - Plugin architecture for future extensions
   - Community contribution support

## Project Goals
1. Provide a free, open-source alternative to paid web automation tools
2. Maintain user privacy by keeping all operations local
3. Offer flexibility in LLM selection to balance performance and cost
4. Build a community-driven project with active contribution
5. Create an intuitive, accessible interface for AI web automation

## Target Audience
- AI enthusiasts looking for powerful web automation
- Developers seeking an open-source alternative to OpenAI Operator
- Users concerned about privacy in AI tools
- Researchers exploring multi-agent systems
- Productivity-focused users looking to automate repetitive web tasks

## Success Criteria
1. Stable and reliable web automation capabilities
2. Active community engagement and contributions
3. Positive user feedback on performance and usability
4. Growing feature set driven by community needs
5. Maintained commitment to privacy and open-source principles

## Project Scope
### In Scope
- Chrome extension development
- Multi-agent system implementation
- Support for major LLM providers
- Web automation capabilities
- User interface for agent interaction

### Out of Scope
- Web scraping at massive scale
- Replacing human judgment for critical tasks
- Server-side processing of user data
- Creating autonomous agents outside browser context
