# Project Brief: Algonius Browser

## Project Overview
Algonius Browser is an open-source AI web automation tool that runs directly in the browser as a Chrome extension. It serves as a free alternative to OpenAI Operator, offering flexible LLM options and a multi-agent system architecture. It is a fork of the original Nanobrowser project with a focused mission on MCP integration.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Multi-agent System**
   - Specialized AI agents that collaborate to accomplish complex web workflows
   - Three primary agents: Navigator, Planner, and Validator

2. **Web Automation**
   - Browse and interact with websites autonomously
   - Perform complex tasks across multiple pages
   - Extract and analyze information from web pages

3. **User Interface**
   - Interactive side panel with chat interface
   - Real-time status updates of agent actions
   - Conversation history management

4. **LLM Integration**
   - Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama)
   - Custom configuration for each agent
   - Option for local model deployment

5. **MCP Integration**
   - Expose browser capabilities to external AI systems via Model Context Protocol
   - Implement browser state as MCP resources
   - Implement browser operations as MCP tools
   - Secure communication through Chrome Native Messaging

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Privacy & Security**
   - Local browser execution (no cloud services)
   - Secure handling of user credentials
   - Protection of sensitive browsing data
   - Secure Native Messaging communication

2. **Performance**
   - Efficient browser automation
   - Responsive user interface
   - Effective resource management
   - Optimized message passing for Native Messaging

3. **Extensibility**
   - Open-source codebase
   - Plugin architecture for future extensions
   - Community contribution support
   - MCP-based interoperability with external AI systems

## Project Goals
1. **Enhanced MCP Integration**: Expose browser automation capabilities to external AI systems through the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
2. **Standardized Interface**: Provide a standardized interface allowing external systems to control browser navigation, element interaction, and content extraction
3. **Multi-Agent System Leverage**: Utilize the multi-agent architecture with planning, navigation, and validation agents to execute complex web tasks
4. **Cross-Platform AI Interoperability**: Enable AI assistants and tools to seamlessly utilize browser capabilities regardless of platform or provider
5. **Open Source Extensibility**: Maintain the project as open source, welcome community contributions, and establish a browser automation platform that can be integrated with other systems
6. Provide a free, open-source alternative to paid web automation tools
7. Maintain user privacy by keeping all operations local
8. Offer flexibility in LLM selection to balance performance and cost

## Target Audience
- AI enthusiasts looking for powerful web automation
- Developers seeking an open-source alternative to OpenAI Operator
- AI developers looking to integrate browser capabilities into their systems
- Users concerned about privacy in AI tools
- Researchers exploring multi-agent systems
- Productivity-focused users looking to automate repetitive web tasks

## Success Criteria
1. Stable and reliable web automation capabilities
2. Active community engagement and contributions
3. Positive user feedback on performance and usability
4. Growing feature set driven by community needs
5. Maintained commitment to privacy and open-source principles

## Project Scope
### In Scope
- Chrome extension development
- Multi-agent system implementation
- Support for major LLM providers
- Web automation capabilities
- User interface for agent interaction
- MCP SEE service implementation via Native Messaging
- Integration with external AI systems

### Out of Scope
- Web scraping at massive scale
- Replacing human judgment for critical tasks
- Server-side processing of user data
- Creating autonomous agents outside browser context
