# Active Context

## Current Focus
**Project Status**: Successfully completed major refactoring to remove LLM/Agent features and focus purely on MCP browser automation.

## Recent Major Changes (December 2024)
- **Removed LLM/Agent System**: Eliminated all AI agent, conversation, and LLM integration features
- **Streamlined Architecture**: Focused project purely on MCP browser automation capabilities
- **Cleaned Codebase**: Removed unnecessary directories and dependencies
- **Simplified UI**: Kept only essential MCP host control popup interface

## System Architecture (Post-Refactoring)

## Core Components

### MCP Host (Go)
- **Purpose**: Native messaging bridge between Chrome and MCP protocol
- **Location**: `mcp-host-go/`
- **Status**: Fully functional, all tests passing
- **Key Features**: Tool routing, error handling, lifecycle management

### Chrome Extension
- **Background Script**: Clean service worker with MCP tool handlers
- **Popup Interface**: Simple control panel for MCP host start/stop
- **Content Scripts**: DOM tree building and interaction utilities
- **Status**: Streamlined, LLM-free, focused on browser automation

### Available MCP Tools
1. `navigate_to` - URL navigation with timeout
2. `get_browser_state` - Current browser/tab state
3. `get_dom_state` - DOM structure extraction
4. `click_element` - Element clicking by selector/text
5. `set_value` - Input field value setting
6. `scroll_page` - Page scrolling
7. `manage_tabs` - Tab creation/switching/closing

## Development Patterns

### Error Handling
- Structured error types with codes and messages
- Graceful degradation for missing elements
- Timeout handling for async operations

### Testing Strategy
- Integration tests for all MCP tools
- Chrome extension lifecycle testing
- DOM interaction validation

### Code Organization
- TypeScript throughout for type safety
- Modular handler pattern for MCP tools
- Clean separation of concerns

## Project Status
- **Build**: ✅ All packages build successfully
- **Tests**: ✅ All integration tests passing  
- **Functionality**: ✅ All MCP tools working correctly
- **Architecture**: ✅ Clean, focused, maintainable

## Next Steps
- System is ready for production use
- Future enhancements could include additional DOM interaction tools
- Performance optimizations for large DOM trees
- Enhanced debugging and error reporting tools

## Key Learning & Decisions
- **Simplification Success**: Removing LLM features dramatically simplified the architecture
- **MCP Focus**: Pure browser automation through MCP protocol is a clean, powerful approach
- **Modular Design**: Handler pattern makes adding new tools straightforward
- **Testing Investment**: Comprehensive integration tests provide confidence in functionality
