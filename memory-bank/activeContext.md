# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**Algonius Browser Continuous Optimization Process Update** - Successfully simplified and improved the optimization workflow documentation in .clinerules

### manage_tabs Cross-Window Support Fix ✅ NEWLY COMPLETED
- **Problem**: The manage_tabs tool only worked for tabs within the current browser window
- **Issue**: When users had multiple browser windows open, tab switching failed for tabs in other windows
- **Root Cause**: Tab activation without proper window focus caused the operation to fail silently
- **Solution**: Enhanced the switchTab() method in BrowserContext to:
  - Get the target tab's window ID using `chrome.tabs.get()`
  - Focus the window containing the tab using `chrome.windows.update()`
  - Then activate the tab within that window using `chrome.tabs.update()`
- **Files Modified**:
  - `chrome-extension/src/background/browser/context.ts` - Enhanced switchTab() method ✅
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Added window focus logic before tab activation
  - Maintained existing tab activation and page attachment flow
  - Preserved all error handling and timeout mechanisms
- **Impact**: Tab management now works seamlessly across all browser windows
- **Date Completed**: 2025-06-12

  - ✅ Used `click_element` tool for submission
- **Technical Validation**: Demonstrated real-world effectiveness of MCP browser automation tools
- **Result**: Successfully contributed to project improvement through automated GitHub workflow

### Scrollable Container Detection Enhancement ✅ FULLY COMPLETED
- **Problem**: The scroll_page tool always scrolled the entire window, leading to poor user experience on pages with multiple scrollable areas (SPAs, modals, tables)
- **Issue**: Modern web applications often have specific scrollable containers (main content areas, modal dialogs, data tables) that should be the focus of scroll operations
- **Solution**: Enhanced the scroll_page tool to automatically detect and prioritize the most appropriate scrollable container
- **Files Modified**:
  - `chrome-extension/src/background/task/scroll-page-handler.ts` - Added intelligent container detection ✅
  - `test-scrollable-container.html` - Comprehensive test page with multiple container scenarios ✅
  - `mcp-host-go/tests/integration/scrollable_container_test.go` - Integration tests for container detection ✅
  - `docs/scrollable-container-detection.md` - Complete documentation of the feature ✅

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Container Detection Algorithm**: Scans all elements to identify scrollable containers based on overflow properties and content size ✅
- **Prioritization Logic**: Prefers in-viewport containers over out-of-viewport, larger containers over smaller, and specific containers over body/html ✅
- **Fallback Behavior**: Falls back to window scrolling if no suitable container is found ✅
- **All Scroll Actions Supported**: up, down, to_top, to_bottom all work within detected containers ✅
- **Container Information Capture**: Records tag name, ID, classes, and dimensions for reliable container relocation ✅
- **Integration Tests**: Comprehensive test suite validates container detection and prioritization logic ✅
- **Test Coverage**: Both basic detection and prioritization scenarios thoroughly tested ✅

### Comprehensive Browser Automation Testing ✅ COMPLETED
- **Full Tool Suite Verification**: All MCP browser automation tools tested and working correctly
- **Real-world Testing**: Performed comprehensive testing on actual websites (Google.com, bloombot.app)
- **Tool Integration**: Verified seamless interaction between all browser automation tools
- **Test Results**:
  - ✅ `navigate_to` - Successfully navigates to URLs and loads pages
  - ✅ `get_dom_extra_elements` - Accurately detects and lists interactive elements with pagination
  - ✅ `set_value` - Properly sets values in form inputs (text, textarea, select, etc.)
  - ✅ `click_element` - Successfully clicks interactive elements (buttons, links, form controls)
  - ✅ `scroll_page` - Enhanced scrolling with intelligent container detection
  - ✅ `manage_tabs` - Tab management operations working correctly
- **Real-world Scenarios**: Successfully performed complex browser automation workflows
- **Element Detection**: Verified accurate element indexing and interaction capabilities
- **Form Interaction**: Confirmed reliable form filling and submission functionality

### Previous Achievements
- **Disabled Interactive Elements Visibility Enhancement**: Enhanced DOM state output to include disabled form elements with [DISABLED] indicator
- **GitHub Issue Templates Branding Update**: Fixed branding inconsistencies across all GitHub issue templates
- **Windows Installation Documentation Fix**: Fixed critical Windows registry documentation gap
- **PowerShell Installer**: Complete Windows installation script with registry support
- **Cross-Platform Parity**: Windows now matches Linux/macOS installation experience

## Next Steps
