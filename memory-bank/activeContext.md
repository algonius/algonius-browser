  - ✅ Navigated to GitHub new issue page
  - ✅ Selected feature request template
  - ✅ Filled out title and detailed description
  - ✅ Used `set_value` tool for form inputs
  - ✅ Used `click_element` tool for submission
- **Technical Validation**: Demonstrated real-world effectiveness of MCP browser automation tools
- **Result**: Successfully contributed to project improvement through automated GitHub workflow

### Scrollable Container Detection Enhancement ✅ FULLY COMPLETED
- **Problem**: The scroll_page tool always scrolled the entire window, leading to poor user experience on pages with multiple scrollable areas (SPAs, modals, tables)
- **Issue**: Modern web applications often have specific scrollable containers (main content areas, modal dialogs, data tables) that should be the focus of scroll operations
- **Solution**: Enhanced the scroll_page tool to automatically detect and prioritize the most appropriate scrollable container
- **Files Modified**:
  - `chrome-extension/src/background/task/scroll-page-handler.ts` - Added intelligent container detection ✅
  - `test-scrollable-container.html` - Comprehensive test page with multiple container scenarios ✅
  - `mcp-host-go/tests/integration/scrollable_container_test.go` - Integration tests for container detection ✅
  - `docs/scrollable-container-detection.md` - Complete documentation of the feature ✅

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Container Detection Algorithm**: Scans all elements to identify scrollable containers based on overflow properties and content size ✅
- **Prioritization Logic**: Prefers in-viewport containers over out-of-viewport, larger containers over smaller, and specific containers over body/html ✅
- **Fallback Behavior**: Falls back to window scrolling if no suitable container is found ✅
- **All Scroll Actions Supported**: up, down, to_top, to_bottom all work within detected containers ✅
- **Container Information Capture**: Records tag name, ID, classes, and dimensions for reliable container relocation ✅
- **Integration Tests**: Comprehensive test suite validates container detection and prioritization logic ✅
- **Test Coverage**: Both basic detection and prioritization scenarios thoroughly tested ✅

### Comprehensive Browser Automation Testing ✅ COMPLETED
- **Full Tool Suite Verification**: All MCP browser automation tools tested and working correctly
- **Real-world Testing**: Performed comprehensive testing on actual websites (Google.com, bloombot.app)
- **Tool Integration**: Verified seamless interaction between all browser automation tools
- **Test Results**:
  - ✅ `navigate_to` - Successfully navigates to URLs and loads pages
  - ✅ `get_dom_extra_elements` - Accurately detects and lists interactive elements with pagination
  - ✅ `set_value` - Properly sets values in form inputs (text, textarea, select, etc.)
  - ✅ `click_element` - Successfully clicks interactive elements (buttons, links, form controls)
  - ✅ `scroll_page` - Enhanced scrolling with intelligent container detection
  - ✅ `manage_tabs` - Tab management operations working correctly
- **Real-world Scenarios**: Successfully performed complex browser automation workflows
- **Element Detection**: Verified accurate element indexing and interaction capabilities
- **Form Interaction**: Confirmed reliable form filling and submission functionality

### Previous Achievements
- **Disabled Interactive Elements Visibility Enhancement**: Enhanced DOM state output to include disabled form elements with [DISABLED] indicator
- **GitHub Issue Templates Branding Update**: Fixed branding inconsistencies across all GitHub issue templates
- **Windows Installation Documentation Fix**: Fixed critical Windows registry documentation gap
- **PowerShell Installer**: Complete Windows installation script with registry support
- **Cross-Platform Parity**: Windows now matches Linux/macOS installation experience

## Next Steps
Browser automation research capabilities are now fully validated:
1. ✅ Successfully navigated complex websites with cookie consent handling
2. ✅ Demonstrated multi-page research workflows
3. ✅ Verified all browser automation tools work in real-world scenarios
4. ✅ Confirmed ability to gather comprehensive platform information
5. ✅ Validated seamless integration between all MCP browser tools

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Real-world Effectiveness**: Browser automation tools proven effective for research and information gathering
- **Cookie Handling**: Automatic handling of consent dialogs ensures smooth navigation
- **Multi-site Navigation**: Tools work consistently across different website architectures
- **Information Extraction**: DOM state analysis enables comprehensive platform understanding
- **Research Workflows**: Complex multi-step research processes can be fully automated

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Systematic Approach**: Start with main sites, then explore documentation and technical details
- **Cookie Management**: Always handle consent dialogs early in navigation flow
- **DOM Analysis**: Use DOM state to understand page structure and available interactions
- **Tool Integration**: Combine navigation, clicking, and information extraction for complete workflows
- **Documentation Focus**: Technical documentation sites provide valuable architectural insights
