# Active Context: Nanobrowser

## Current Work Focus

The Nanobrowser project is currently focused on establishing its Memory Bank documentation system. This sets the foundation for maintaining project context between development sessions and ensures consistent knowledge transfer.

### Primary Objectives
1. **Memory Bank Initialization**: Creating the core documentation structure
2. **Knowledge Capture**: Documenting current understanding of the project
3. **Context Preservation**: Ensuring continuity of project knowledge

### Active Development Areas
- **Documentation Infrastructure**: Setting up the memory-bank directory and initial files
- **Project Context Mapping**: Capturing project structure and relationships
- **System Architecture Documentation**: Outlining the multi-agent system design

## Recent Changes

As this is the initial setup of the Memory Bank, there are no previous changes to document. This section will be updated as the project evolves to track significant changes to the codebase, architecture, or project direction.

## Next Steps

After establishing the Memory Bank, the following steps are recommended:

1. **Codebase Exploration**:
   - Deeper examination of agent implementation details
   - Analysis of the communication patterns between agents
   - Review of LLM integration mechanisms

2. **Feature Development**:
   - Identify priority features from the roadmap
   - Analyze current implementation status
   - Prepare development plans for upcoming features

3. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Review current testing approach
   - Develop testing strategies for the multi-agent system
   - Implement validation mechanisms for agent behaviors

4. **Documentation Enhancement**:
   - Expand Memory Bank with additional context as discovered
   - Create technical documentation for developers
   - Develop user documentation for extension users

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Multi-Agent Architecture
- **Decision Point**: How to balance responsibilities between agents
- **Consideration**: Each agent's role should be clearly defined with minimal overlap
- **Current Approach**: Three-agent system with Planner, Navigator, and Validator roles

### LLM Provider Integration
- **Decision Point**: How to abstract provider differences
- **Consideration**: Need to maintain flexibility while providing a consistent interface
- **Current Approach**: Adapter pattern for provider-specific implementations

### User Experience
- **Decision Point**: How to communicate agent activities transparently
- **Consideration**: Users need visibility into what actions are being taken
- **Current Approach**: Real-time status updates in the side panel

### Performance Optimization
- **Decision Point**: How to minimize token usage and API costs
- **Consideration**: Balance between effectiveness and efficiency
- **Current Approach**: Strategic prompt design and context management

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- **Package Structure**: Monorepo with clear separation of concerns
- **Component Design**: Reusable UI components with clear interfaces
- **Agent Implementation**: Modular design with specialized responsibilities

### Development Workflow
- **Version Control**: GitHub with conventional commits
- **Quality Assurance**: ESLint and Prettier with pre-commit hooks
- **Build Process**: Turbo for monorepo optimization

### UI Design
- **Component Library**: Tailwind-based custom components
- **Interaction Design**: Clear feedback and status indicators
- **Accessibility**: Focus on usable and accessible interfaces

## Learnings and Project Insights

As this is the initial setup phase, specific learnings are limited. This section will be populated as the project develops and insights are gained through implementation and testing.

### Initial Observations
- The project has a well-defined structure using modern web technologies
- The multi-agent approach provides a clear separation of concerns
- The monorepo structure facilitates code sharing and consistency

This document will be regularly updated to reflect the current state of the project, recent decisions, and evolving insights.
