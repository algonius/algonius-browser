## Active Decisions and Considerations

### MCP Integration Strategy
- **Decision Point**: How to best integrate MCP protocol with browser automation
- **Consideration**: Need to balance security, performance, and usability
- **Current Approach**: Chrome Native Messaging for secure local communication between extension and external AI systems

### Native Messaging Implementation
- **Decision Point**: How to structure the Native Host architecture
- **Consideration**: Need reliable message passing and error handling
- **Current Approach**: Modular design with separate components for messaging, MCP server, browser resources, and tools

### Execution Flow Optimization
- **Decision Point**: How to balance planning frequency and execution efficiency
- **Consideration**: The planning step is costly in tokens but essential for complex tasks
- **Current Approach**: Periodic planning based on a configurable interval (planningInterval)

### Browser Context Management
- **Decision Point**: How to effectively manage browser state across operations
- **Consideration**: Need to maintain accurate state while minimizing browser API calls
- **Current Approach**: Centralized browserContext that provides abstraction over Puppeteer

### Agent Communication
- **Decision Point**: How agents pass context and maintain state between steps
- **Consideration**: Need to balance comprehensive context with token efficiency
- **Current Approach**: MessageManager service with specialized message types for different interactions

### Error Recovery
- **Decision Point**: How to handle failures during task execution
- **Consideration**: Need balance between persistence and recognizing irrecoverable situations
- **Current Approach**: Tracking consecutive failures with configurable thresholds (maxFailures)

### Validation Strategy
- **Decision Point**: How to verify task completion effectively
- **Consideration**: Need to confirm actual completion vs. premature termination
- **Current Approach**: Dedicated Validator agent with configurable validation attempts (maxValidatorFailures)

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### MCP Integration Patterns
- **Resource-Tool Separation**: Clear distinction between browser state (resources) and browser operations (tools)
- **Schema-Based Validation**: All MCP tools use JSON Schema for request validation
- **Layered Architecture**: Separation of messaging protocol, MCP server, and browser integration

### Execution Patterns
- **Initialization-Planning-Execution-Validation Cycle**: The core task execution pattern
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Agents communicate state through a structured event system
- **Action Registry Pattern**: Navigator uses a registry of possible actions with schema validation

### Error Handling Patterns
- **Graduated Recovery**: Multiple attempts before failure with configurable thresholds
- **State Preservation**: Maintaining context even through errors to enable recovery
- **Event Propagation**: Error events bubble up through the system for user visibility

### Browser Interaction Patterns
- **Element Indexing**: Using numeric indices for element selection rather than complex selectors
- **Action Intent Documentation**: Each action includes an intent description for transparency
- **Action Result Tracking**: Standardized ActionResult objects for consistent outcome reporting

## Learnings and Project Insights

Our ongoing development and code analysis has revealed several important insights about the system:

### MCP Integration Insights
- Chrome Native Messaging provides a secure and efficient channel for MCP protocol integration
- The implemented MCP client-server architecture includes:
  - Robust message handling with request IDs and timeouts
  - Error propagation and recovery mechanisms
  - State synchronization between browser and MCP host
  - Modular design allowing future extensions
- Exposing browser capabilities as MCP resources and tools creates a powerful extension point for AI systems
- Structured message passing with error handling is critical for reliable communication
- Separating browser state (resources) from operations (tools) provides a clean abstraction
- The active-passive architecture (extension sends updates to host) ensures minimal performance impact

### Agent System Architecture
- The multi-agent approach effectively delegates specialized responsibilities but requires careful coordination
- The Planner agent serves as a strategic coordinator, while Navigator handles tactical execution
- Validator provides an important quality check that improves overall reliability
- MCP integration can potentially enhance agent capabilities with external specialized models

### Execution Flow Insights
- The system uses a loop-based execution model with state transitions rather than a linear process
- Task execution is broken into steps with coordinated handoffs between agents
- Event system plays a critical role in maintaining execution state and enabling monitoring
- Native Messaging introduces additional considerations for state synchronization

### Browser Automation Capabilities
- The Navigator has a comprehensive set of web interaction capabilities (17 distinct operations)
- Element interaction relies on a combination of indexing and DOM understanding
- Operations are designed with intent documentation for better transparency and troubleshooting
- MCP tools can provide standardized access to these capabilities for external systems

### Performance Considerations
- Planning is computationally expensive but essential for complex tasks
- Context management between agent calls significantly impacts token usage
- Action validation and error handling are crucial for reliable automation
- Native Messaging adds minimal overhead but requires careful buffer management

This document will continue to be updated as we gain deeper insights through ongoing code analysis and development efforts.
