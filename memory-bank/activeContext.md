   - Registers tools and resources with both server implementations simultaneously
   - Provides unified start/stop/status management with proper error handling
   - Ensures consistent behavior across both protocols
   - Thread-safe operations with proper mutex usage

3. **Main Application Updates (`cmd/mcp-host/main.go`)**:
   - Updated to use the new dual server instead of single Native Messaging server
   - Added environment variable configuration for SSE server (port, base URL, base path)
   - Enhanced logging to show both server endpoints on startup
   - Graceful shutdown for both servers with proper error handling

4. **Build and Testing**:
   - All code compiles successfully with Go build system
   - Fixed type compatibility issues with mark3labs/mcp-go PropertyOption types
   - Binary builds correctly with `make build`
   - Created and successfully ran test to verify dual server functionality
   - Ready for testing with external MCP clients

5. **Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive `docs/dual-server-architecture.md` documentation
   - Updated `memory-bank/progress.md` with dual server implementation details
   - Documented configuration options, usage examples, and troubleshooting

## Implementation Benefits

### For Chrome Extension Users
- **Unchanged Interface**: Existing extension functionality remains identical
- **Performance**: Direct Native Messaging communication maintains efficiency
- **Security**: Leverages Chrome's built-in security model

### For External AI Tools
- **Standard Protocol**: Industry-standard MCP over HTTP/SSE
- **Language Agnostic**: Any language with HTTP/SSE support can connect
- **Development Tools**: Easy integration with development workflows
- **Testing**: Simplified testing and debugging capabilities

### For Developers
- **Unified Codebase**: Single implementation serves both protocols
- **Consistency**: Same tools and resources available via both interfaces
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for business logic
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new tools/resources to both servers

## Server Endpoints

The dual server now provides:

1. **Native Messaging**: Available via Chrome extension (existing functionality)
2. **SSE Server**: Available at `http://localhost:8080/mcp` (configurable)
   - `GET /mcp/sse` - SSE endpoint for real-time communication
   - `POST /mcp/tools/{name}` - Tool execution endpoint
   - `GET /mcp/resources/{uri}` - Resource access endpoint

## Next Steps Recommendations

With the dual server implementation complete, suggested next priorities:

1. **Testing with External Clients**:
   - Test SSE server with external MCP clients
   - Verify tool and resource functionality via HTTP/SSE
   - Test concurrent usage of both Native Messaging and SSE protocols

2. **Additional Tools and Resources**:
   - Implement additional browser resources beyond `current_state`
   - Add more browser operation tools beyond `navigate_to`
   - Enhance existing tools with additional capabilities

3. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Add authentication for SSE server (for production use)
   - Implement rate limiting for external clients
   - Add metrics and monitoring capabilities

4. **Documentation and Examples**:
   - Create client examples in multiple programming languages
   - Document integration patterns for AI frameworks
   - Create end-user installation and usage guides

## Configuration

The dual server supports environment variable configuration:

```bash
# SSE Server Configuration
SSE_PORT=":8080"                    # Port for SSE server
SSE_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080" # Base URL for SSE server
SSE_BASE_PATH="/mcp"                # Base path for MCP endpoints

# Runtime Configuration
RUN_MODE="production"               # Runtime mode (development/production)
```
