- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new tools/resources to both servers

## Server Endpoints

The dual server now provides:

1. **Native Messaging**: Available via Chrome extension (existing functionality)
2. **SSE Server**: Available at `http://localhost:8080/mcp` (configurable)
   - `GET /mcp/sse` - SSE endpoint for real-time communication
   - `POST /mcp/tools/{name}` - Tool execution endpoint
   - `GET /mcp/resources/{uri}` - Resource access endpoint

## Next Steps Recommendations

With the logging system optimized, suggested next priorities:

1. **Testing**:
   - Test MCP host with logging disabled to stdout
   - Verify that logs are correctly written to the configured file path
   - Test different log configuration options through environment variables
   - Verify that Native Messaging continues to function correctly

2. **Additional Tools and Resources**:
   - Implement additional browser resources beyond `current_state`
   - Add more browser operation tools beyond `navigate_to`
   - Enhance existing tools with additional capabilities

3. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Add authentication for SSE server (for production use)
   - Implement rate limiting for external clients
   - Add metrics and monitoring capabilities

4. **Documentation and Examples**:
   - Create client examples in multiple programming languages
   - Document integration patterns for AI frameworks
   - Create end-user installation and usage guides

## Configuration

The MCP host now supports the following environment variables for logging configuration:

```bash
# Logging Configuration
LOG_FILE="/path/to/custom/logfile.log"   # Specific log file path
LOG_DIR="/path/to/log/directory"         # Directory for logs (uses mcp-host.log as filename)
LOG_LEVEL="debug|info|warn|error"        # Log level
LOG_TO_STDOUT="true"                     # Optional: Enable stdout logging (NOT recommended with Native Messaging)
LOG_TO_STDERR="true"                     # Optional: Enable stderr logging (NOT recommended with Native Messaging)
LOG_FORMAT="console"                     # Use console format for logs (vs JSON)
GO_ENV="development"                     # Development mode enables additional logging features

# SSE Server Configuration
SSE_PORT=":8080"                         # Port for SSE server
SSE_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080"     # Base URL for SSE server
SSE_BASE_PATH="/mcp"                     # Base path for MCP endpoints

# Runtime Configuration
RUN_MODE="production"                    # Runtime mode (development/production)
```
