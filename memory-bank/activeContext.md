# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**GitHub Issue Management** - Successfully created feature request for enhanced `set_value` tool capabilities via browser automation

## Recent Changes
### GitHub Issue Creation via Browser Automation ✅ NEWLY COMPLETED
- **Task**: Successfully created a feature request on GitHub using browser automation tools
- **Issue Created**: "[Feature]: Enhanced Browser Automation Capabilities" (Issue #13)
- **Automation Flow**: 
  - ✅ Navigated to GitHub new issue page
  - ✅ Selected feature request template
  - ✅ Filled out title and detailed description
  - ✅ Used `set_value` tool for form inputs
  - ✅ Used `click_element` tool for submission
- **Technical Validation**: Demonstrated real-world effectiveness of MCP browser automation tools
- **Result**: Successfully contributed to project improvement through automated GitHub workflow

### Scrollable Container Detection Enhancement ✅ FULLY COMPLETED
- **Problem**: The scroll_page tool always scrolled the entire window, leading to poor user experience on pages with multiple scrollable areas (SPAs, modals, tables)
- **Issue**: Modern web applications often have specific scrollable containers (main content areas, modal dialogs, data tables) that should be the focus of scroll operations
- **Solution**: Enhanced the scroll_page tool to automatically detect and prioritize the most appropriate scrollable container
- **Files Modified**:
  - `chrome-extension/src/background/task/scroll-page-handler.ts` - Added intelligent container detection ✅
  - `test-scrollable-container.html` - Comprehensive test page with multiple container scenarios ✅
  - `mcp-host-go/tests/integration/scrollable_container_test.go` - Integration tests for container detection ✅
  - `docs/scrollable-container-detection.md` - Complete documentation of the feature ✅

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Container Detection Algorithm**: Scans all elements to identify scrollable containers based on overflow properties and content size ✅
- **Prioritization Logic**: Prefers in-viewport containers over out-of-viewport, larger containers over smaller, and specific containers over body/html ✅
- **Fallback Behavior**: Falls back to window scrolling if no suitable container is found ✅
- **All Scroll Actions Supported**: up, down, to_top, to_bottom all work within detected containers ✅
- **Container Information Capture**: Records tag name, ID, classes, and dimensions for reliable container relocation ✅
- **Integration Tests**: Comprehensive test suite validates container detection and prioritization logic ✅
- **Test Coverage**: Both basic detection and prioritization scenarios thoroughly tested ✅

### Comprehensive Browser Automation Testing ✅ COMPLETED
- **Full Tool Suite Verification**: All MCP browser automation tools tested and working correctly
- **Real-world Testing**: Performed comprehensive testing on actual websites (Google.com)
- **Tool Integration**: Verified seamless interaction between all browser automation tools
- **Test Results**:
  - ✅ `navigate_to` - Successfully navigates to URLs and loads pages
  - ✅ `get_dom_extra_elements` - Accurately detects and lists interactive elements with pagination
  - ✅ `set_value` - Properly sets values in form inputs (text, textarea, select, etc.)
  - ✅ `click_element` - Successfully clicks interactive elements
  - ✅ `scroll_page` - Enhanced scrolling with intelligent container detection
  - ✅ `manage_tabs` - Tab management operations working correctly
- **Real-world Scenarios**: Successfully performed complex browser automation workflows
- **Element Detection**: Verified accurate element indexing and interaction capabilities
- **Form Interaction**: Confirmed reliable form filling and submission functionality

### Previous Achievements
- **Disabled Interactive Elements Visibility Enhancement**: Enhanced DOM state output to include disabled form elements with [DISABLED] indicator
- **GitHub Issue Templates Branding Update**: Fixed branding inconsistencies across all GitHub issue templates
- **Windows Installation Documentation Fix**: Fixed critical Windows registry documentation gap
- **PowerShell Installer**: Complete Windows installation script with registry support
- **Cross-Platform Parity**: Windows now matches Linux/macOS installation experience

## Next Steps
The scrollable container detection enhancement is now complete:
1. ✅ Implemented container detection algorithm with proper prioritization
2. ✅ Enhanced scroll-page-handler.ts with intelligent container selection
3. ✅ Created comprehensive test page with multiple container scenarios
4. ✅ Added integration tests for container detection functionality
5. ✅ Documented the complete feature with examples and troubleshooting

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Intelligent Scrolling**: Tool now automatically selects the most appropriate scrollable container
- **Viewport Prioritization**: In-viewport containers are preferred over out-of-viewport ones
- **Size-based Selection**: Among similar containers, larger ones are preferred
- **Container Type Preference**: Specific containers (divs, mains, etc.) preferred over body/html
- **Fallback Strategy**: Window scrolling maintained as fallback when no containers detected

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Modern Web App Support**: Enhanced support for SPAs, modal dialogs, and complex layouts
- **Automatic Detection**: No configuration required - behavior determined by page structure
- **Consistent API**: All existing scroll actions work seamlessly with container detection
- **Performance Conscious**: Container detection is efficient and doesn't impact scroll performance
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing functionality preserved with enhanced behavior

## Learnings and Project Insights
- **Modern Web Complexity**: Contemporary web applications require intelligent scrolling behavior
- **Container Hierarchy**: Proper prioritization is crucial for intuitive user experience
- **Testing Importance**: Comprehensive test scenarios essential for validating complex logic
- **Documentation Value**: Clear documentation with examples helps users understand new capabilities
- **Automation Benefits**: Intelligent container detection improves automated testing reliability
- **TypeScript Advantages**: Strong typing ensures robust container detection and manipulation
