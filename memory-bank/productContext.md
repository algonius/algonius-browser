# Product Context: Nanobrowser

## Why Nanobrowser Exists

Nanobrowser was created to address several key needs in the AI web automation space:

1. **Accessibility Gap**: Premium web automation tools like OpenAI Operator are expensive ($200/month), putting them out of reach for many users. Nanobrowser provides these capabilities at no cost, with users only paying for their own API usage.

2. **Privacy Concerns**: Many existing solutions send user data to cloud services, creating privacy risks. Nanobrowser runs entirely in the local browser, keeping sensitive information and credentials on the user's device.

3. **Limited LLM Flexibility**: Most tools lock users into specific LLM providers. Nanobrowser allows users to choose from multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama) and to assign different models to different agents based on their needs.

4. **Closed-Source Limitations**: Many web automation tools are closed-source, creating a "black box" that users can't inspect, modify, or extend. Nanobrowser is fully open-source, enabling transparency and community contribution.

5. **Need for Specialized Agents**: Web automation benefits from specialized agents working in coordination. Nanobrowser's multi-agent architecture allows for more effective task delegation and execution.

### For Developers
- **Offers Open Platform for Extension**: Provides a foundation for building more specialized web automation tools.
- **Demonstrates Multi-Agent Architecture**: Shows practical implementation of agent collaboration systems.
- **Promotes Transparency**: Open-source nature allows for code inspection and security validation.
- **Enables Community Collaboration**: Creates opportunity for shared development and improvement.

## How Nanobrowser Should Work

Nanobrowser functions through a collaborative multi-agent system:

1. **User Interaction Flow**:
   - User installs Chrome extension
   - User configures LLM providers and assigns models to agents
   - User opens the side panel and issues a task in natural language
   - Agents collaborate to complete the task while providing status updates
   - Results are presented in the side panel with option for follow-up questions

2. **Agent System Architecture**:
   - **Planner Agent**: Breaks down complex tasks into manageable steps
   - **Navigator Agent**: Executes browser actions and interprets web content
   - **Validator Agent**: Verifies task completion and results accuracy

3. **Key Operational Principles**:
   - All processing occurs locally in the browser
   - API keys are stored locally and never shared
   - LLM interactions are minimal and purposeful to reduce costs
   - Clear feedback on current status and progress
   - Transparency in agent actions and decision-making

## User Experience Goals

Nanobrowser aims to deliver a user experience that is:

1. **Intuitive**: Easy to install, configure, and use without technical expertise
2. **Transparent**: Clear visibility into what actions are being taken by agents
3. **Responsive**: Quick feedback and status updates throughout task execution
4. **Flexible**: Adaptable to different user preferences and LLM selections
5. **Trustworthy**: Privacy-preserving and secure handling of sensitive information
6. **Empowering**: Enabling users to accomplish complex web tasks through simple prompts
